        <h1 class="text-center">SIAM is a revolutionary invention in the laundry world.</h1>
        SIAM is an alternative to sorting and ironing socks manually. It makes
        doing the laundry easy. No more tireless days ironing
        shirts. No more long hours sorting socks. SIAM takes the stress out of
        rushing to do the laundry. By a push of a button, you can either tell SIAM
        to sort the socks, iron the shirt, or do both at the same time. 
        There are claws that sort the socks. You throw a pile of socks into the 
        box and the claws recognize the size and color of them and sorts them 
        accordingly. There is also a dewrinkle system in the machine that sprays
        the shirts which gets out most of the wrinkles. 
        <br>
        <br>
        SIAM was invented by a team of high schoolers for their Entrepreneurship
        Project. They all had a common problem in their life which was their
        frustration with sorting their laundry and ironing their clothes. 
        <a href ="https://foldimate.com" target="_blank">FoldiMate</a> and 
        <a href ="https://helloeffie.com" target ="_blank">Effie</a> inspired them
        to create their own product to solve their problem. SIAM is currently the 
        only product in the world that sorts clothes. It is not available to the
        public yet, but when it is launched, the projected retail price is $399.99.
